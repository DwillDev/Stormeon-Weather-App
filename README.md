# Stormeon: A Pokemon Weather App

Stormeon is a weather app inspired by the Eeveelutions in the Pokemon franchise. The theme changes based on the weather conditions in the city that the user chooses via the Google Places API or geolocation.


## Technologies Used
- HTML 
- SCSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- BEM
## APIs Used
- OpenWeatherMap API
- Google Places API
- BigCloud API


## Features

- 6 different themes based on the weather

## Lessons Learned

This is my first project where I had to come up with the design myself. Using figma, I wireframed the site before getting into the coding portion of it. I quickly learned that web design can be a more arduous task than writing the actual code while working on Stormeon. I also learned about making promises and how to use multiple APIs in a website.

In addition, I learned the basics of BEM and SCSS in order to build and organize Stormeon.


## Roadmap

- Cleaning up the page responsiveness

- Organizing HTML and SCSS with a better grid system

- Implementing cards in the navigation allowing users to store cities
